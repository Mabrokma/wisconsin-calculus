TYPESETTING.  

I have been typsetting this using the Texlive 2011 distribution (and also the
 similar Mactex 2011 distribution, which is based on texlive).

To get the document as they were used in math 221, fall 2012, you need to
install the Linux Libertine and Linux Biolinum fonts on your computer.  These
are public domain fonts and can be obtained from http://www.linuxlibertine.org/
To use these fonts in Latex you have to typset the document using XeTeX (or
really xelatex).  In particular, from a command line (in a terminal), typeset
the document with the command "xelatex free221".

If you want to use the standard (ams)latex fonts comment the relevant lines in
the file "preamble.tex" and typeset using "pdflatex free221"

THE DRAWINGS.

All figures are located in the directory called "figures" They are mostly of two
kinds: those that were drawn using Inkscape (www.inkscape.org), and those that
were programmed in python.

For the inkscape drawings the svg version is the main version of the drawing.
When done with the drawing you should also save the drawing from within Inkscape
as a pdf file, which can then be imported into the latex document.  Here there
are two options depending on how you want to handle the text in the drawing.
Best is to create a pdf_tex file (this option appears when you save as pdf in
Inkscape), and then "\input" the pdf_tex file into your latex document.  If you
don't want latex to take care of the text in the drawing, then you can save as
pdf and include the pdf using \includegraphics{}.

Some drawings were programmed in Python and postscript following an idea of Joel
Robbin.  Each drawing is made by writing and then running a little python script
that describes the drawing.  The file graphics.py contains the necessary
functions that help python produce a pdf file with the drawing and a latex file
with the annotations.
