  <h1>Vector Geometry in Three dimensional space</h1>

  <h2>Three dimensional space</h2>
  The world according to our first and second semester calculus courses is flat:
  except for a brief digression about surfaces of revolution, everything that we
  discussed in Math 221 and 222 took place in the $(x,y)$-plane.  All curves were
  curves in the plane and all functions had graphs that were curves in the plane.
  This semester we leave two dimensions behind and enter the three dimensional
  world.  In order to understand the objects we will be dealing with, such as
  curves that are free to loop around in space, or functions whose graphs are
  themselves two dimensional curved surfaces, we will first review some three
  dimensional geometry.  In particular, we will review the use of vectors in three
  dimensional geometry.

  <h2>Geometric description of vectors</h2>
  \label{sec:geometric-description-of-vectors}
  <h3>Points and their coordinates</h3>
  We are used to describing the location of any point in the plane by choosing two
  perpendicular &ldquo;coordinate axes&rdquo; (the $x$ and $y$ axes), and specifying the
  corresponding $(x,y)$-coordinates of any given point.  In the same way we can
  describe where points are in three dimensional space by choosing three mutually
  perpendicular axes, which we call the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes.  To say where some
  given point $P$ is, we travel from the origin to $P$, first along the $x$ axis,
  then parallel to the $y$-axis, and finally parallel to the $z$-axis.  The
  distances we had to go in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions are the $x$, $y$, and
  $z$ coordinates of our point $P$.

  <p>
  <img src="../../figures/234/01xyz-axes.svg" align="right">
  To determine the location of points in three dimensional
  space (such as the center of the blue sphere in this drawing), we
  should choose three coordinate axes, and specify three numbers:
  the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates of the point.  

  <h3>Vectors</h3>
  While points and their coordinates are used to described locations in space,
  vectors are used to describe \emph{displacements}, i.e.~how to go from one point
  to another.  Such a displacement has a size (how far we have to go), and a
  direction (which way do we go).  Vectors also get used in non-geometric
  situations to describe objects that have size and direction, e.g.~velocities and
  forces in physics are typical examples of vector-like objects.

  <h4>Informal definition of &ldquo;vectors&rdquo;</h4>
  We will think of a vector as an arrow connecting two points.  If the points are
  $A$ and $B$ then we call the vector $\tpv AB$. If we translate a vector $\tpv
  AB$ \emph{without turning it} then we say that the resulting vector $\tpv CD$ is
  the same vector as the original vector $\tpv AB$.  A more precise way  of saying
  that we should be able to move $\tpv AB$ &ldquo;without turning,&rdquo; is to insist that
  the line segments $AB$ and $CD$ should be parallel, and have the same length and
  orientation.

  <img src="../../figures/234/005equalvectors.png" align="right" width=30%>
  \caption{This figure contains \emph{four} points ($A$, $B$, $C$, $D$),
  \emph{two} line segments ($AB$ and $CD$), but \emph{only one} vector since
  $\tpv AB$ and $\tpv CD$ represent the same vector:  $\tpv AB = \tpv CD$.}
  
  We say that the arrows $\tpv AB$ and $\tpv PQ$ \emph{both represent the same
  vector.}  Since both $\tpv AB$ and $\tpv PQ$ are the same vector we will often
  want to use a notation for vectors that does not emphasize any particular choice
  of initial-~and endpoint.  The notation we will use in this course is
  \[
  \va = \tpv AB = \tpv PQ,
  \]
  i.e., a single letter with an arrow on top will always stand for a
  vector in this course.

  <h2>Arithmetic of vectors</h2>
  \label{sec:arithmetic-of-vectors}
  To add two vectors $\tpv AB$ and $\tpv PQ$ we first translate the vector $\tpv
  PQ$ so that its initial point becomes $B$; let the result of this translation be
  the vector $\tpv BC$.  Then, by definition, the sum of $\tpv AB$ and $\tpv PQ$
  is $\tpv AC$: in a formula,
  \[
  \tpv AB + \tpv PQ = \tpv AB + \tpv BC = \tpv AC.
  \]
  An equivalent way of adding two vectors $\tpv AB$ and $\tpv PQ$ is to move the
  vectors around until they have the same initial point.  Two vectors with a
  common initial point form two sides of a parallelogram (see
  Figure~\ref{fig:adding-vectors-parallelogram}) and the sum of the two vectors is
  the diagonal of that parallelogram.
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \input ../figures/234/005adding-vectors-parallelogram.pdf_tex
  \caption{{\bfseries Using a parallelogram to add vectors. } To find $\tpv AB +
  \tpv AD$ we move the vector $\tpv AD$ so that its initial point is at $B$,
  i.e.~the endpoint of $\tpv AB$.  This gives us a parallelogram $ABCD$, where
  $\tpv AD = \tpv BC$.  Therefore $\tpv AB+\tpv AD = \tpv AB+\tpv BC = \tpv AC$
  }
  \label{fig:adding-vectors-parallelogram}
  \end{figure}

  One can also multiply vectors with numbers.  To multiply a vector $\va$ with a
  positive real number $t>0$, we multiply the length of the vector by a factor
  $t$, without changing the direction of the vector.
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \input ../figures/222/05scalar-mult.pdf_tex
  \caption{Multiplying and subtracting vectors}
  \end{figure}
  <h2>Vector algebra</h2>
  The addition and multiplication of vectors and numbers satisfy a number of
  algebraic properties that should look familiar, as they are very similar to the
  usual algebraic properties for adding and multiplying numbers.  Here they are:
  \begin{align*}
  \va+\vb&=\vb+\va &&& \text{commutative law}\\
  (\va+\vb)+\vc &= \va+(\vb+\vc) & t\cdot(s\cdot\va) &= (ts)\cdot \va
  &\text{associative laws}\\
  t\cdot(\va+\vb) & = t\va+t\vb & (t+s)\va &= t\va + s\va
  &\text{distributive laws}
  \end{align*}
  <h2>Component representation of vectors</h2>

  <h3>Components of a vector in two dimensional space</h3>
  \label{sec:comp-vect-two}
  There is a way to represent a vector by specifying a list of numbers instead of
  by giving a geometric description of the vector.  To do this for vectors in the
  plane, we must choose two perpendicular coordinate axes (the &ldquo;$x$&rdquo; and &ldquo;$y$&rdquo;
  axes).  We define
  \begin{align*}
  \ves1 &= \text{ vector with length $1$, in the direction of the $x$ axis} \\
  \ves2 &= \text{ vector with length $1$, in the direction of the $y$ axis}
  \end{align*}
  Then any other vector can be written as the sum of a multiple of $\ves1$ and
  another multiple of $\ves2$:
  \begin{equation}
  \va = a_1\ves1 + a_2 \ves2.
  \label{eq:vector-a-in-components}
  \end{equation}
  See Figure~\ref{fig:vector-in-components}.  The numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$ are
  called the \emph{components of the vector $\va$.}  If we know the components
  $a_1$ and $a_2$ of a vector, and if we know the two vectors $\ves1$ and $\ves2$,
  then we can reconstruct the vector $\va$ by using the formula
  \eqref{eq:vector-a-in-components}.

  \begin{figure}[h]
  \input{../figures/234/005vector-components.pdf_tex}
  \caption{Describing a vector in terms of its components.}
  \label{fig:vector-in-components}
  \end{figure}

  Instead of using the notation \eqref{eq:vector-a-in-components}, one very often
  writes
  \begin{equation}
  \va = \vek a_1 \\ a_2 \tor,
  \text{ or }
  \va = \begin{bmatrix}
  a_1 \\ a_2
  \end{bmatrix}, \text{ or } \va = \langle a_1, a_2\rangle.
  \label{eq:vector-a-as-column-vector}
  \end{equation}
  This notation says that $\va$ is the vector whose components are $a_1$ and
  $a_2$.  Since the two vectors $\ves1$ and $\ves2$ depend on our choice of
  coordinate axes, we can only use the component notation if it is clear to
  everyone how we chose the coordinate axes.

  The first way of writing the vector, in which the components $a_1$ and $a_2$ are
  listed in a column enclosed in either parentheses or square brackets, is the
  standard way of writing &ldquo;column vectors,&rdquo; and is used in linear algebra
  courses (math 320, 340, 341, etc.), as well as by most computational software
  (<a href="">Matlab$^{\rm TM}$</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a>, etc.).  The other way of writing the components,
  i.e.~as $\langle a_1, a_2\rangle$, also
  gets used, especially when one has to type the equations rather than write them
  by hand.

  <h3>Components of a vector in three dimensional space</h3>
  \label{sec:comp-vect-three}
  The preceding also applies to vectors in three dimensional space: instead of
  choosing two coordinate axes we choose three axes, and call them the $x$, $y$,
  and $z$ axes (or, the $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$ axes).  Then we define
  $\vi$, $\vj $, and $\vk$ (or $\ves1$, $\ves2$, and $\ves3$) to be vectors of
  length one in the direction of the three coordinate axes.  A vector $\va$ in
  space can then be written as a combination of the three vectors $\vi$, $\vj$,
  and $\vk$, namely,
  \[
  \va = a_{1}\vi + a_2 \vj + a_3 \vk, \text{ or }
  \va = \vek a_1\\a_2\\a_3 \tor.
  \]
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \sffamily\color{darkbluegreen}
  \input{../figures/234/005vector-components3D.pdf_tex}

  1839--1903\\[2pt]
  %\includegraphics[width=1in]{Josiah_Willard_Gibbs.jpg}\\
  \tiny\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs}}%
  The $\ves1$, $\ves2$, $\ves3$ notation is more systematic, but the $\vi$, $\vj$,
  $\vk$ notation, which was introduced into vector geometry and vector calculus by
  J.W.Gibbs, is also very common.

  <h3>Length of a vector whose components are given</h3>
  \label{sec:length-vector-given-components}
  We will write
  \[
  \|\va\|
  \]
  for the length of a vector $\va$.  If the vector is given in components, 
  \[
  \va = a_1\ves1+a_2\ves2, 
  \text{ or }
  \va = a_1\ves1+a_2\ves2+a_3\ves3, 
  \]
  then the length of the vector is determined by Pythagoras' law (see
  Figures~\ref{fig:vector-in-components} and~\ref{fig:vector-in-components-3d}):
  \[
  \|\va\| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2}, \quad
  \text{ or }\quad
  \|\va\| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2+a_3^2}. 
  \label{eq:length-of-vector-from-components}
  \]



  <h2>The dot product</h2>
  There are two different descriptions of the dot product of two
  vectors: one geometric, and the other in terms of the components of
  the vectors.

  <h3>Geometric description of the dot product</h3>
  If $\va$ and $\vb$ are two given vectors, then, by definition,
  \marginpar{\footnotesize\sffamily\centering\color{darkbluegreen}%
  \input ../figures/234/005dot-product.pdf_tex

  The dot product between two vectors.
  }
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dotproduct-geometric}
  \va\dpp\vb = \|\va\| \, \|\vb\|\,\cos \theta,
  \end{equation}
  where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors $\va$ and $\vb$.

  <h3>The dot product in terms of vector components</h3>
  If we choose an orthonormal set of vectors $\ves1,\ves2,\ves3$, and write
  \[
  \va = a_1\ves1+a_2\ves2+a_3\ves3=\vek a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \tor,\qquad
  \vb = b_1\ves1+b_2\ves2+b_3\ves3=\vek b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \tor,
  \]
  then
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dotproduct-algebraic}
  \va\dpp\vb = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3.
  \end{equation}
  The fact that \eqref{eq:dotproduct-geometric} and \eqref{eq:dotproduct-algebraic}
  always give the same result is not obvious (the formulas look very different), and
  requires a proof.  A very common proof relies on the law of cosines (it was given in math 222 -- see also Problem~\ref{prb:law-of-cosines-and-dotprod})

  <h3>Algebraic properties of the dot product</h3>
  \label{sec:dotproduct-algebraic-properties}%
  The dot product has the following algebraic properties, which we will
  use very often throughout this course:
  \begin{align*}
  \va\dpp\vb &= \vb\dpp\va & \text{commutative} \\
  s(\va\dpp\vb) &= (s\va)\dpp\vb & \text{associative} \\
  (\va+\vb)\dpp\vc & = \va\dpp\vc + \vb\dpp\vc. & \text{distributive}
  \end{align*}
  We will not prove these properties here.  Proofs can be given if one
  starts either from the algebraic description of the dot-product
  \eqref{eq:dotproduct-algebraic}, or from the geometric description
  \eqref{eq:dotproduct-geometric} (although the distributive property is
  more difficult to prove from the geometric description than from the
  algebraic description.)

  The sign of the dot product tells us if the angle between two vectors is acute,
  obtuse, or if the vectors are perpendicular:
  \begin{align}
  \va\perp\vb  &\iff \va\dpp\vb=0 \\
  \va\dpp\vb>0 &\iff \theta<\frac{\pi}{2}\\
  \va\dpp\vb<0 &\iff \theta>\frac{\pi}{2}.
  \end{align}

  <h2>The cross product</h2>
  As with the dot product, the cross product of two vectors also has a
  geometric description, and a description in terms of components.

  \subsection{Geometric description of the cross product} Let $\va$  
  and $\vb$ be two vectors in three dimensional space, then their
  \emph{cross product} is the vector $\va\cp\vb$ that satisfies
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\va\cp\vb$ is perpendicular to $\va$, and also to $\vb$
  \item the length of $\va\cp\vb$ is given by
  \[
  \|\va\cp\vb\| = \|\va\|\,\|\vb\|\,\sin\theta,
  \]
  where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\va$ and $\vb$,
  \item the three vectors $\va$, $\vb$, $\va\cp\vb$ satisfy the
  \emph{right hand rule:} if on your right hand $\va$ is the index
  finger and $\vb$ is the middle finger, then your thumb points in the
  direction of $\va\cp\vb$.  See Figure~\ref{fig:cross-product}.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{figure}[t]
  \input ../figures/222/05crossprod-corkscrew.pdf_tex
  \caption{The cross product: $\va\cp\vb$ is perpendicular to both
  $\va$ and $\vb$; its direction follows from the right-hand rule. }
  \label{fig:cross-product}
  \end{figure}
  The length of the cross product of two vectors has a geometric
  interpretation.  Namely, the quantity $\|\va\|\,\|\vb\|\,\sin\theta$
  is exactly the are of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors $\va$
  and $\vb$.
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \input
  ../figures/222/05area-parallelogram-spanned-by-vectors.pdf_tex
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Algebraic description of the cross product} If $\va$  
  and $\vb $ are given by \eqref{eq:dotproduct-geometric}, i.e.~by
  \[
  \va = a_1\ves1+a_2\ves2+a_3\ves3=\tvek a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \ttor,\qquad
  \vb = b_1\ves1+b_2\ves2+b_3\ves3=\tvek b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \ttor,
  \]
  then
  \[
  \va \cp\vb = \vek
  a_2b_3 - a_3b_2\\
  a_3b_1 - a_1b_3\\
  a_1b_2 - a_2b_1\tor.
  \]

  <h3>Algebraic properties of the cross product</h3>
  \label{sec:cross-product-algebraic-properties}
  The cross product has the distributive property, namely,
  \begin{equation}
  (\va+\vb)\cp\vc  = \va\cp\vc + \vb\cp\vc,
  \label{eq:cross-product-distributive}
  \end{equation}
  holds true for any three vectors $\va$, $\vb$, $\vc$.

  The cross product is \emph{not commutative}: $\va\cp\vb$ and
  $\vb\cp\va$ are not the same thing.  Instead, we have :
  \begin{equation}
  \va\cp\vb = -\vb\cp\va.
  \end{equation}
  Because of this property the cross product is said to be
  &ldquo;\textit{anti-commutative.}&rdquo;

  The associative property fails completely for the cross product: for
  most vectors $\va$, $\vb$, $\vc$ one has
  \begin{equation}\color{red}
  \carefulnow\carefulnow\qquad
  (\va\cp\vb)\cp\vc\; {\boldsymbol \neq}\; \va\cp(\vb\cp\vc)
  \qquad \carefulnow\carefulnow
  \label{eq:cross-product-not-associative}
  \end{equation}

  If you need a vector that is perpendicular to two given vectors, take
  their cross product.

  The length of the cross product $\va\cp\vb$ is the area of the
  parallelogram spanned by those vectors.

  <h2>The triple product</h2>
  \label{sec:determ-triple-prod}
  Just as two vectors in the plane form a parallelogram, three vectors
  in space will form a shape called a parallelepiped.  By definition, a
  parallelepiped is a solid body each of whose faces is a parallelogram.

  \begin{figure}[h]
  \def\svgwidth{200pt}
  \input ../figures/234/01parallelepiped.pdf_tex\hfill
  \def\svgwidth{130pt}
  \input ../figures/234/01parallelepiped-flipped.pdf_tex
  \caption{\textbf{A parallelepiped spanned by three vectors $\va$,
  $\vb$, $\vc$.}  Since the base of the parallelepiped is a
  parallelogram with edges $\vb$ and $\vc$, we have \\
  \null\qquad Area of base~$= \|\vb\cp\vc\|$.\\
  The height of the parallelepiped is $\|\va\|\cos\theta$, and
  therefore the volume is given by \\
  \null\qquad Volume = $\text{height}\cdot\text{area of base}
  = \|\va\| \, \|\vb\cp\vc\| \cos\theta
  = \va\dpp\bigl(\vb\cp\vc\bigr)$.\\
  This derivation applies to the situation on the left, where the
  vector $\va$ and the cross product $\vb\cp\vc$ point in the same
  direction.  If these vectors form an obtuse angle, as is the case
  on the right, then $\cos\theta<0$, and the height is
  $-\|\va\|\cos\theta$.  In that case one has\\
  \null\qquad Volume = $\text{height}\cdot\text{area of base}
  = - \|\va\| \, \|\vb\cp\vc\| \cos\theta 
  = - \va\dpp\bigl(\vb\cp\vc\bigr)$.
  }
  \label{fig:volume-of-parallelpiped}
  \end{figure}
  If we are given three vectors $\va$, $\vb$, and $\vc$, then the volume
  of the parallelepiped they determine is given by the formula
  \[
  \text{&ldquo;Volume equals Area of base times height&rdquo;}
  \]
  In terms of the three vectors this is
  \begin{equation}
  V = \left| \va\dpp\bigl(\vb\cp\vc\bigr)\right|.
  \label{eq:volume-of-parallelpiped}
  \end{equation}
  A derivation is sketched in Figure~\ref{fig:volume-of-parallelpiped}.
  The quantity $\va\dpp(\vb\cp\vc)$ (without the absolute values) is
  called the \emph{triple product} of the three vectors $\va$, $\vb$,
  and $\vc$.  Apart from its use in computing the volume of a
  parallelepiped, the triple product appears in many other contexts.  At
  first sight the expression $\va\dpp(\vb\cp\vc)$ suggests that the
  order in which the vectors appear is important, but this turns out not
  to be true.  One has 
  \[
  \va\dpp\bigl(\vb\cp\vc\bigr) = \vb\dpp\bigl(\vc\cp\va\bigr) =
  \vc\dpp\bigl(\va\cp\vb\bigr)
  \]
  for any $\va,\vb,\vc$.

  <h2>Determinants</h2>
  \label{sec:determinants}
  For any four numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, one defines the $2\times2$
  determinant to be
  \begin{equation}
  \deter a&b \\ c& d
  \minant
  =ad-bc\,.
  \label{eq:determinant-2x2}
  \end{equation}
  One can also define $3\times3$ determinants.  Namely, for any nine
  numbers $a_1, \dots, c_3$ one defines
  \begin{equation}
  \deter
  a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\
  a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\
  a_3 & b_3 & c_3
  \minant
  =
  a_1b_2c_3 - a_1b_3c_2 - a_2b_1c_3 + a_2b_3c_1 +a_3b_1c_2 - a_3b_2c_1\,.
  \label{eq:triple-product}
  \end{equation}
  This can be written as
  \begin{align}
  \deter
  \color{red}a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\
  \color{red}a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\
  \color{red}a_3 & b_3 & c_3
  \minant
  &={\color{red}a_1}\bigl(b_2c_3-b_3c_2\bigr)
  - {\color{red}a_2}\bigl(b_1c_3-b_3c_1\bigr)
  + {\color{red}a_3}\bigl(b_1c_2-b_2c_1\bigr)
  \label{eq:determinant-expanded-along-column}
  \\
  &= {\color{red}a_1} \deter b_2 & c_2 \\ b_3 & c_3 \minant
  - {\color{red}a_2} \deter b_1 & c_1 \\ b_3 & c_3 \minant
  + {\color{red}a_3} \deter b_1 & b_1 \\ b_2 & b_2 \minant
  \notag
  \end{align}
  where each coefficient in the first row is multiplied with the
  $2\times2$ determined that remains after one deletes the row and
  column containing the coefficient.

  Instead of expanding along the first row one can also expand along the
  first column:
  \begin{equation}
  \deter
  \color{red}a_1 & \color{red}b_1 & \color{red}c_1 \\
  a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\
  a_3 & b_3 & c_3
  \minant
  = {\color{red}a_1}\deter b_2 & c_2 \\ b_3 & c_3 \minant
  - {\color{red}b_1}\deter a_2 & c_2 \\ a_3 & c_3 \minant
  + {\color{red}c_1}\deter a_2 & b_2 \\ a_3 & b_3 \minant
  \label{eq:determinant-expanded-along-row}
  \end{equation}
  Many other mnemonic devices exist to remember how to compute a
  $3\times3$ determinant.  A popular trick is &ldquo;Sarrus' rule&rdquo; (see
  Figure~\ref{fig:Sarrus}.)

  One can also define larger determinants, i.e.~$4\times4$, $5\times5$,
  etc, and generally $n\times n$ determinants.  The theory, which is
  beyond the scope of this course, is treated in linear algebra courses
  such as Math 320, 340, or 341.

  <h2>Determinants, the triple product, and the cross product</h2>
  \label{sec:determ-triple-prod-cross-prod}
  If the numbers $a_1, \dots, c_3$ in a determinant happen to be the
  components of three vectors $\va$, $\vb$, $\vc$, i.e.~if
  \[
  \va = \vek a_1\\ a_2 \\a_3\tor, \vb = \vek b_1\\ b_2 \\b_3\tor, \vc =
  \vek c_1\\ c_2 \\c_3\tor,
  \]
  then the corresponding determinant is exactly the triple product:
  \begin{equation}
  \left|
  \begin{array}{ccc}
  a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\
  a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\
  a_3 & b_3 & c_3
  \end{array}
  \right|= \va\dpp\bigl(\vb\cp\vc\bigr).
  \end{equation}%
  \begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[scale=1.30]{05determinant-shortcut2.pdf}
  \caption{\textbf{Computing $3\times3$ determinants. } There are several
  shortcuts to remember how to compute a $3\times3$ determinant.
  Pictured here is &ldquo;Sarrus' rule,&rdquo; which tells us to copy the
  first two columns of the determinant to the right of the
  determinant, and read off the six terms in the determinant by
  following the diagonals. }
  \label{fig:Sarrus}
  \end{figure}%
  Related to this is the following practical trick for computing the
  cross product of two column vectors.  Given two column vectors $\vb$
  and $\vc$ one can write their cross product as 
  \begin{align*}
  \vek b_1\\b_2\\b_3\tor\cp \vek c_1\\c_2\\c_3\tor
  &=
  \deter
  \ves1 & b_1 & c_1 \\
  \ves2 & b_2 & c_2 \\
  \ves3 & b_3 & c_3
  \minant \\
  &=  \deter b_2 & c_2 \\ b_3 & c_3 \minant \ves1
  - \deter b_1 & c_1 \\ b_3 & c_3 \minant \ves2
  + \deter b_1 & c_1 \\ b_2 & c_2 \minant \ves3 .
  \end{align*}
  The $3\times3$ determinant in this equation is unusual in that some of its
  entries are vectors instead of numbers.  The intention of this notation is that
  one expand the determinant along the first column, as in
  \eqref{eq:determinant-expanded-along-column} and then interpret the result as a
  vector.

  <h2>Defining equations for lines and planes</h2>
  \label{sec:defining-equations-lines-and-planes}
  <h3>Lines</h3>
  \label{sec:defining-eq-lines}
  Let $\ell$ be a line in the plane, and suppose we know one point $A$ on the
  line, and that we also have a vector $\vn$ that is perpendicular to the line
  (and we exclude $\vn=\vvv0$.) Such a vector is called a \emph{normal vector} to
  the line.  Given any other point $X$ in the plane we can form the vector $\tpv
  AX$ and consider its dot-product with the normal.  We have
  \[
  \vn \dpp \tpv AX = \|\vn\| \, \|\tpv AX\| \cos \theta,
  \]
  where $\theta$ is the angle between the normal vector $\vn$ and $\tpv AX$.

  \begin{figure}[h]
  \hspace{-1em}\input ../figures/222/05distance-to-line.pdf_tex
  \end{figure}
  The combination $\|\tpv AX\|\cos \theta$ is, up to its sign, the distance from
  the line $\ell$ to the point $X$: If $X$ lies on the side of $\ell$ at which the
  normal vector points then $\vn\dpp\tpv AX>0$; if $X$ lies on the other side then
  $\vn\dpp\tpv AX<0$.  We therefore have the following formula for \textit{the
  distance between a point $X$ and the line $\ell$:}
  \begin{equation}
  d = \frac{\vn \dpp \tpv AX	}{\|\vn\|}
  \label{eq:distance-to-line}
  \end{equation}
  When we use this equation to compute the distance from $X$ to $\ell$, it is good
  to recall that if $\vx=\tvek x_1\\x_2\ttor$ and $\va = \tvek a_1\\ a_2\ttor$ are
  the position vectors of the points $X$ and $A$, then  
  \[
  \tpv AX = \vx-\va = \vek x_1-a_1 \\ x_2-a_2\tor.
  \]
  Moreover, the length of the normal vector is $\|\vn\| = \sqrt{n_1^2+n_2^2}$, so
  we can rewrite \eqref{eq:distance-to-line} as 
  \[
  d = \frac{n_1(x_1-a_1) + n_2(x_2-a_2)}{\sqrt{n_1^2 + n_2^2}}.
  \]
  This last formula is more impressive than \eqref{eq:distance-to-line}, but it is
  better to remember \eqref{eq:distance-to-line}.

  The equation for the distance from any point $X$ to a given line $\ell$ is also
  important because it gives us \emph{the defining equation} for the line $\ell$.
  The defining equation is an equation that tells us for any given point $X$ in
  the plane if that point is on the line or not.  Since $X$ is on $\ell$ exactly
  when the distance from $\ell$ to $X$ vanishes, it follows from
  \eqref{eq:distance-to-line} that $X$ is on $\ell$ if and only if 
  \begin{equation}
  \vn\dpp\tpv AX = 0.
  \label{eq:defining-eqn-for-line}
  \end{equation}
  We can again rewrite this equation in a few different ways.  If we want to write
  it in terms of the position vectors of $A$ and $X$, then we get
  \[
  \vn \dpp \bigl(\vx-\va\bigr) = 0, \qquad
  \text{ i.e.: }\qquad
  \vn\dpp\vx = \vn\dpp\va.
  \]
  Written without vectors, but in terms of the coordinates of the points $A$,
  $X$, and the components of the normal vector $\vn$, we can write this last
  version of our equation as
  \[
  n_1x_1+n_2x_2 = n_1a_1+n_2a_2.
  \]

  <h3>Planes</h3>
  \label{sec:defining-eq-planes}
  We can repeat the derivation of the distance from a point to a line in
  the plane and derive a formula for the distance from a point in three
  dimensional space to a given plane.  The drawings are harder to make
  (at first only, practice makes perfect!), but the resulting formulas
  are the same.
  \begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \input ../figures/234/01distance-to-plane.pdf_tex
  \end{figure}

  The distance from a point $X$ to a plane $\cP$ is given by equation
  \eqref{eq:distance-to-line}, where $\vn$ is a normal vector to the
  plane (a vector that is perpendicular to the plane), and $A$ is some
  point on the plane that we happen to know.


  <h2>Problems</h2>
  \begin{multicols}{2}
  \problemfont  
  \problem Explain how you can use the dot product to find the angle  
  between the vectors $\va = 2\vi-3\vj$, and $\vb=\vj+\vk$.

  \problem For which value(s) of the number $s$ are the vectors  
  \[
  \va =\vek s \\1-s\tor \text{ and }
  \vb = \vek 2\\3\tor
  \]
  perpendicular?  For which values of $s$ do they make an acute angle?
  \answer  
  Compute the dot product: $\va\dpp\vb = 2s+3(1-s) = 3-s$.  When the
  dot-product vanishes the vectors are perpendicular; this happens when
  $s=3$.  The angle between the vectors is acute is the dot-product is
  positive.  This happens when $3-s>0$, i.e.~when $s<3$.

  \subprob Find the angle between the two planes $BDE$ and $ACH$.  
  (The angle between two planes is the same as the angle between their normal

  of the planes and compute the angle between these two vectors.)

  \subprob Find the angle between the two planes $BDE$ and $HFC$.  

  \problem \subprob Draw two vectors $\va$ and $\vb$ for which  
  $\va$ has length 3, $\vb$ has length $5$, and for which $\va\dpp\vb=-12$.
  How many solutions are there?%
  \answer  
  The problem is open-ended because it doesn't specify what &ldquo;draw&rdquo; means.

  If you are allowed to use a calculator and a protractor, then you could use the
  dot product to compute the angle $\theta$ between the two vectors; then, using
  your protractor, draw two line segments that make this angle, and mark off
  lengths 3 and 5 to get the vectors.  From the dot-product and the two lengths
  you find $3\times5\times\cos\theta = -12$, so $\cos\theta = - \frac{12}{15}=
  -0.8$, which implies $\theta = \arccos (-0.8) \approx 2.498\dots$ radians, or
  $\theta\approx 143.13\dots$ degrees.

  This turns out to be only half the answer:  we have forgotten that the equation
  $\cos\theta = -0.8$ has many more solutions than just $\arccos (-0.8)$.  One
  other solution is $-\arccos(-0.8)$.  This gives us two vectors $\vb$ with
  $\|\vb\|=5$ and $\|\vb\|=5$ and $\va\dpp\vb = -12$.

  A different approach goes like this: you could assume $\va=3\ves1$, which has
  length 3, and $\vb=\tvek b_1\\b_2\ttor$.  The condition that $\vb$ have length 5
  then says $b_1^2 + b_2^2 = 5^2 = 25$, while the dot-product is $\va\dpp\vb =
  a_1b_1+a_2b_2 = 3b_1$.  Since the dot-product must be $-12$ we find
  $b_1=-\frac{12}{3}=-4$.  Using the length of $\vb$ leads to
  $b_2=\sqrt{25-(-4)^2} = \pm3$.  Thus we find two solutions: $\vb = \tvek -4\\
  \pm3\ttor = -4\ves1\pm3\ves2$.

  You make the drawing.
  \endanswer

  \subprob Can there be two vectors $\va$ and $\vb$ whose lengths are  
  $\|\va\| = 3$ and $\|\vb\|=5$, and whose inner product is $\va\dpp\vb = 25$?
  \answer  
  No.  The inner product of two vectors is $\va\dpp\vb = \|\va\|\,\|\vb\|
  \cos\theta$, and therefore it can never be larger than $\|\va\|\,\|\vb\|$.

  of vectors $\va$ and $\vb$?  Either give a proof (using the algebraic
  properties or the algebraic or geometric descriptions).

  \subprob $(\va+\vb)\dpp(\va-\vb) = \|\va\|^2 - \|\vb\|^2$~?  
  \answer  
  True:
  \begin{align*}
  (\va+\vb)\dpp(\va-\vb) &=(\va+\vb) \dpp \va  - (\va+\vb) \dpp\vb\\
  &= \va \dpp \va +\vb \dpp \va  - \va \dpp\vb - \vb \dpp\vb\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 + \| \vb \|^2.
  \end{align*}
  \endanswer

  \subprob  If  $\va\perp\vb$ then\\[1ex] 
  \null\hfill$\|\va+\vb\|^2 = \|\va\|^2 + \|\vb\|^2$~?% 
  \answer  
  True:  This is Pythagoras' theorem.  Here is an algebraic derivation:
  \begin{align*}
  \|\va+\vb\|^2 &= (\va+\vb) \dpp (\va+\vb)\\
  &= (\va+\vb) \dpp \va  + (\va+\vb) \dpp\vb\\
  &= \va \dpp \va +\vb \dpp \va  + \va \dpp\vb + \vb \dpp\vb\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 + 2 \va \dpp\vb + \| \vb \|^2\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 + \| \vb \|^2.
  \end{align*}
  \endanswer

  \subprob If  $\va\perp\vb$ then\\[1ex] 
  \null\hfill$\|\va-\vb\|^2 = \|\va\|^2 - \|\vb\|^2$  ~?%
  \answer  
  Not so.
  The same computation as for the previous problem shows
  \begin{align*}
  \|\va - \vb\|^2 &= (\va-\vb) \dpp (\va-\vb)\\
  &= (\va-\vb) \dpp \va  - (\va-\vb) \dpp\vb\\
  &= \va \dpp \va -\vb \dpp \va  - \va \dpp\vb + \vb \dpp\vb\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 - 2 \va \dpp\vb + \| \vb \|^2\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 + \| \vb \|^2.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore
  \[
  \|\va-\vb\|^2 = \|\va\|^2 - \|\vb\|^2
  \]
  only is true if $\vb=\vvv0$.

  \problem  
  This problem is about &ldquo;cross division,&rdquo; i.e.~can you solve
  $\va\cp\vb=\vc$ for $\vb$ if you know $\va$ and $\vc$?

  \subprob Let  
  \begin{equation*}
  \va =\ves1-\ves3,\qquad
  \vc = \ves1+3\ves2+2\ves3.
  \end{equation*}
  Find a vector $\vb$ for which $\va\cp\vb=\vc$, if there is such a thing.  (Hint:
  if $\vc=\va\cp\vb$, then what do you know about $\va\dpp\vc$?)
  \answer  
  $\va\dpp\vc=\va\dpp(\va\cp\vb) =0$, but for the two given vectors in the problem
  $\va\dpp\vc = -1\neq0$, so there cannot be a vector $\vb$ with $\va\cp\vb=\vc$
  as $\vc$ is not perpendicular to $\va$.
  \endanswer

  \subprob Let $\va = 2\ves1-\ves3$, and $\vc = \ves1+3\ves2+2\ves3$.  
  Find a vector $\vb$ for which $\va\cp\vb=\vc$, if such a thing exists. %
  \answer  
  In this case $\va\perp\vc$, so the argument from the first part of this problem
  doesn't rule out that there might be a solution.  So let's try $\vb =
  \tvek b_1\\b_2\\b_3\ttor$.  Then
  \[
  \va\cp\vb
  = \vek b_2 \\ -b_1-2b_3 \\ 2b_2\tor \stackrel?= \vc
  = \vek 1\\3\\2\tor.
  \]
  Solving this for $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$ leads to $b_2=1$, and $-b_1-2b_3=3$ as
  only remaining equation.  Since we have found $b_2$ there are still two unknowns
  left.  We can choose an arbitrary $b_3$ and set $b_1 = -3-2b_3$, e.g.~$b_3=0$
  works, provided we choose $b_1 = -3$.

  Hint: consider the vector equation $\tpv BC = \tpv AC - \tpv AB$.  You will need
  both the geometric description \eqref{eq:dotproduct-geometric} of the dot
  product, and the algebraic properties from
