p53
in formula between (55) and (56) the right hand side should be divided by delta y and the lefthandside should be f sub y
formula 56: it should be f sub y and delta y

p 86
needs the definition of a critical point

p93
in the equation a y sub x should be y sub k

p96
in the paragraph after formula 108:
the conclusions should be exchanged in this particular example because of the minus sign

formula 116: f sub y

Hope this helps,
